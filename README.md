## 🛠️ Core Gameplay Features

### 1. **Building & Expansion**
- Start with basic structures: tents, solar/wind generators, and a beach.
- Unlock luxurious bungalows, overwater villas, spas, restaurants, eco-attractions, and green transport options (e-buggies, water bikes).
- All assets use colorful, clean low-poly aesthetics.

### 2. **Resource Management & Eco Points**
- In addition to standard currencies (coins, materials, energy), players manage **Eco Points**.
- Actions impact the environment: green initiatives increase Eco Points; overdevelopment reduces them.
- High Eco Points unlock bonuses, VIP tourists, and government grants.

### 3. **Progression & Quests**
- Seasonal system (e.g., rainy season, holidays) introduces dynamic challenges.
- Side quests like:
  - Discovering rare tropical plants
  - Organizing eco-festivals
  - Supporting sustainable fishing
- Rewards include exclusive decorations, animals, and structures.

### 4. **Tourist System & Satisfaction**
- Diverse tourist types: budget travelers, luxury seekers, eco-enthusiasts.
- Satisfaction levels affect income multipliers and resort reputation.
- Tourists leave reviews, influencing future visitor waves.

### 5. **Exploration & Discovery**
- Expand your island gradually; clear areas for development at the cost of Eco Points.
- Add botanical gardens, educational paths, and nature reserves.
- Unlock secret locations (e.g., caves for diving centers).

### 6. **Economy & Finances**
- Income from lodging, souvenirs, services (spa, restaurants).
- Invest in staff, upgrades, and eco-research to unlock new tech.
- Dynamic events like government subsidies or CO₂ tax alerts affect strategy.

### 7. **Monetization (Free-to-Play Model)**
- **Premium Currency**: "Tropical Emeralds" for speeding up tasks or buying exclusive decorations.
- **Reward Ads**: Optional ads for minor bonuses.
- **VIP Pass / Subscriptions**: Daily emeralds, income boost, construction speed-ups.
- **Starter Packs**: Return-player incentives with boosters.

## 🔁 Engaging Mechanics

### 🌞 Day/Night & Seasonal Cycles
- Different behaviors for buildings and tourists depending on time and season.

### 📆 Time-Limited Events
- Monthly global challenges (e.g., "International Eco Resort Festival") with leaderboards and exclusive rewards.

### 🤝 Social Features
- Visit friends' resorts, exchange rare plants, and collaborate via in-game board messages.

### 🌎 Asymmetric Development
- Every island has a unique terrain layout.
- Choose your specialization:
  - **Luxury Resort**: High income, high costs.
  - **Family Fun Resort**: Attractions for all ages.
  - **Eco-Education Resort**: Strong Eco Points, lower monetary yield.

---

## 🎮 Controls & UX/UI

- **PC**: Classic point & click, drag & drop interface.
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized radial menus, gesture-based map navigation.
- Simplified, clear HUD with real-time feedback on currencies, tourist stats, and notifications.

## 🎨 Art Style

- Low-poly 3D models with simple geometry and pastel colors.
- Lightweight assets ensure smooth performance across devices.
- Billboarded animations for flora, optimized lighting for mobile.
- Semi-isometric camera with smooth rotation.

---

## 🧠 Game Balance & Replayability

### 🧬 Long-Term Motivation
- Tech tree with different ecological and financial paths.
- In-game achievements (e.g., “100% Eco Points for 3 Seasons”).
- New biomes unlock at higher levels (e.g., Arctic Eco Resort).

### 🔁 Short-Term Challenges
- Daily missions and weekly events encourage frequent play.
- Example: "Tropical Food Week" boosts restaurant income but increases resource consumption.

### 💸 Monetization & Fairness
- Paid items are cosmetic and don’t break the game balance.
- Time Tokens available for speeding up progress without mandatory purchases.
- Seasonal packs offer thematic decorations with no gameplay advantage.
